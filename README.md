# NDS_workshop

These folders contain files the go with a nonlinear dynamical systems workshop held at the Lyda Hill Institute for Human Resilience @ UCCS, May 16-20, 2022.

Because the scripts will be and the slide decks may be edited on the appropriate day, the versions should not be considered final until after that date.
